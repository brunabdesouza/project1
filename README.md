# Technologies Used

This project was create using **HTML**, **CSS** and **Ruby on Rails** and ActiveRecord and it was built using one-to-many and many-to-many associations. I have used **Heroku** to host this project.

# Features

This app allows the user to create an account and also log in and out. I have created authentication parameters so only the user logged in can access all features of their accounts. Once logged in the user can create a new training plan and can add workouts to it as well as edit or delete their plan.

# Known Bugs

There are still things that need to be fixed before the project is complete.

1. Refactor the code so once the user edit their training plan they can still add more workouts to it.
2. Add an option to customise what exercises they want to add to their workouts.
3. Fix the option to delete the user when they want to delete their account.

# Future Feature
1. Customise the form fields so they are not visible, this will add a more modern look to the website.
2. Let users pick a token that will be their profile picture.
